        <p>I am Raman and Lets travel around India</p>
        <p> was 17 when I first left home to study abroad. I had randomly filled out college applications, with no clue of what I really wanted to do. All I hoped was to go somewhere far away. When I got accepted into Singapore Management University, I was over the moon. I would live on my own for the first time ever, and I couldn’t wait. But as time came to pack up my life in Dehradun and move far out of my comfort zone, I was terrified. In the days leading up to my departure, the butterflies of nervousness fluttered so hard in my tummy that I fell ill and had to delay my flight.

            Over the last few days, I’ve been feeling a similar kind of nervousness.
            
            Of course, I’m in a very different phase of life now. I’m 36, with a whole range of life experiences under my belt, and plenty of grey strands to bear witness! But I type this while in transit to the US, on an educational pursuit I never imagined I’d undertake.
